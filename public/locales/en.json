"h2-q-2": "What makes ResumeKerek unique among other resume builders and templates?",
"h2-q-3": "How can I support ResumeKerek?",
"h2-a-1": "There are two ways to create a resume today. One is to use a resume template, for example, in Word/Google Docs, and customize it to your needs. Another option is to use a resume builder, an online tool that allows you to input your information and automatically generates a resume. Using a resume template requires manual work on formatting, such as copying and pasting text sections and adjusting spaces, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. It's easy to encounter formatting issues, such as using different bullet points or font styles after copying and pasting. On the other hand, a resume builder like ResumeKerek saves time and prevents formatting errors by automatically formatting the resume. It also provides convenience by easily switching font types or sizes with a single click. Ultimately, a resume builder is easier to use compared to a resume template.",
"h2-a-2": "Apart from ResumeKerek, there are other excellent free resume builders, such as Reactive Resume, FlowCV. However, ResumeKerek stands out with two distinct features: ResumeKerek is specifically designed for the American job market and best practices. Unlike other resume builders that cater to a global audience and offer a multitude of customization options, ResumeKerek specifically offers only those options that align with the best practices of the USA. For example, it excludes the possibility of adding a profile photo to avoid bias and discrimination. It offers only essential sections, such as a profile, work experience, education, and skips unnecessary sections, such as references. Additionally, ResumeKerek only offers a single-column resume design from top to bottom, unlike a two-column layout, because a single-column design works better for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). ResumeKerek focuses on privacy. While other resume builders may require email registration and store user data in their databases, ResumeKerek believes that resume data should remain private and only accessible on the user's local machine. Therefore, ResumeKerek does not require registration to use the application, and all entered data is stored in the user's browser, accessible only by the user.",
"h2-a-3": "The best way to support ResumeKerek is to share your thoughts and feedback to help further improve it. You can send us an email at [email]. Another great way to support ResumeKerek is to spread the word. Share it with friends, on social media, or with your school's career center. Our goal is to reach more people who struggle with creating their resumes, and your support in the form of word-of-mouth recommendations would be highly appreciated.",
